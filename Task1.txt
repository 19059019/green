Inserted the following line into the build.xml in the jumit file to display the junit report file.
    <formatter type="plain" usefile="false" />
This showed the error in the expected value of test20, which was fixed by replacing the following line of code:
    check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<0");
with
    check(o3, "(2<=2)&&(aa<2)", "1*v+-1<=0");
